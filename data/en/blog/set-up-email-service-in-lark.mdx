## Introduction

When it comes to email, people usually think of Gmail. Whenever someone needs to sign up or do something related to email, they typically choose to register with Gmail. However, due to the high demand, creating a new email account has become increasingly difficult.
Today, I will guide you on how to create a free email service with Lark.

### 1. Prepare

To do this, you need to prepare a `domain name` and a `personal email`.

- `Email` for registering to use `Lark`
- `Domain name` for registering to use `Lark's email service`

### 2. Create Lark account

#### 2.1 Create account

Link to register [here](https://www.larksuite.com/global/register?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.larksuite.com%2Fdownload&registration_process=global_register&app_id=1001)

#### 2.2 Create organization

When selecting the `size`, you should choose `1-50` to use Lark's free service.

#### 2.3 Setting up the domain name when using Lark

After creating an account, go to the [Lark Admin Console](https://www.larksuite.com/admin) to set up your Lark domain name for easier access.

### 3. Setting up the mail domain

#### 3.1 Installing Lark Mail

Access the [Lark Admin Console](https://www.larksuite.com/admin) and click `Product Settings` > `Mail`.

#### 3.2 Configuring the email

Enter the domain you have prepared and select `only enable email`.

#### 3.3 Setting up the mail domain

Configure Lark's DNS information to your domain DNS and check until the status is `verified` as shown below.

For example, if you are using a domain from Hostinger, go to `DNS / Nameservers` to configure it.

### 3.4 Setting up a business email for the super user

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create an `email service` for use.

As of (2024-08-07), Lark offers a free trial for up to 50 accounts (corresponding to 50 emails). With that many emails, you can comfortably use them for testing purposes.
